						Hi, I'm John - thanks for stopping by!

					Iâ€™m a creative project manager and web developer.  I want to organize a more sustainable world through investment in human potential, community development and technology. Because I believe that sustainability is social endeavor, my work spans the fields of education, social work and web development. I want to advance your organization's mission by offering my unique blend of project management, writing and technical skills.
