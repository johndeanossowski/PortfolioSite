						Hi, I'm John - thanks for stopping by!
					</h3>
			</p>
			<p>
					I help individuals and communities learn new things, discover their passions and reach their potential. My experience spans the fields of education, community development and technology. My best work happens when I'm helping communities move toward sustainability, producing lifelong learning opportunities, supporting online education, and providing academic support for high school and college students. I can advance your organization's mission by offering you my unique blend of project management, writing and technical skills.
