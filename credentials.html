      <p class = "school">Utica College</p>
			<p>I earned my degree while working with students in Utica College's <a href="http://www.utica.edu/academic/yslpp/" target="_blank">Young Scholars Program</a>.  As a math major, I was frequently called upon to tutor junior high and high school math.  My work with these students led me to complete a year of service with <a href="https://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps/americorpsvista" target="_blank">Americorps*VISTA</a>.  Eventually, I worked as program coordiantor for Young Scholars at a junior high school and as the Program's assistant director.  The greatest lesson I learned at Utica College (apart from gaining a great set of analytical skills!) was the power of education and mentoring to create positive changes in the lives of young people.

      <p>For my thesis project, I conducted a qualitative study of the Far West Utica neighborhood.  Over the course of several decades, as the economic decline of the Rust Belt took its toll on Utica, the Far West Utica neighborhood experienced urban blight and significant problems with crime.  I grew up in the neighborhood and still lived there when I took on my thesis project.  I honestly felt overwhelmed by the changes that had taken place in my neighborhood but wanted to know what other residents thought.  My project, which involved in-depth interviews with my neighbors, explored what they thought they could (and could not) control about life in the neighborhood.  What I found renewed my faith in the resiliency of the human spirit.

      <span class="credential">M.S.W. (Social Work)</span>
      <p class = "school">Portland State University</p>
      <p>As a social work student in a 'community-based practice' track, I specialized in sustainable community development.  I came to believe in sustainability as a social movement that should value justice and equity for all people as well as the living systems we belong to.  I wanted to understand ways in which just and equitable prosperity could be achieved while restoring a balance between society and nature.  Thinking back to the economic problems Rust Belt cities like Utica faced, I explored ways that sustainable community development might pave the way to a more prosperous future.  This led to a number of demonstration <a href="http://www.reutica.org" target="_blank">projects</a> and a short documentary film, which I produced with my brother, <a href="http://www.mohawkvalleypictures.com/about/" target="_blank">Matt Ossowski</a>.

      <p class = "school">The Tech Academy</p>
      <p>Technology holds the promise to do so much good in the lives of people, if harnessed appropriately.  I had the good fortune of working on the <a href="http://www.vcponline.com" target="_blank">Virtual Coaching Platform</a> (VCP) during my time as a Research Associate at Portland State's <a href="http://rri.pdx.edu/" target="_blank">Regional Research Institute for Human Services</a>. VCP is a set of web-based tools for analyzing videos of personal interactions.  I worked as a project manager for the VCP and saw how this powerful tool was being used to transform the practice of human service professionals.  I knew I had to learn more about how this technology worked so I signed up for a software development bootcamp down the street from my office! During my time at the Academy I learned about:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Programming/Development:</strong> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, C#</li>
          <li><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> Windows (7 - 10), macOS Sierra</li>
          <li><strong>Frameworks:</strong> Bootstrap, .NET</li>
          <li><strong>IDEs:</strong> MS Visual Studio, IDLE</li>
          <li><strong>Databases:</strong> MySQL, sqlite</li>
          <li><strong>Content Management Systems:</strong> WordPress, Jekyll</li>
      </ul>
I'm still developing my skills in this arena, but I know they will be a valuable part of my professional offerings going forward!
