(Utah)  Springtime is a season that brings forth new life.  And there was hardly a shortage of new life at the Great Salt Lake.  Thousands, hundreds of thousands - possibly millions - of tiny biting gnats had recently hatched in the area we visited.  When I first stepped out of the car to see in person the magnificent natural surroundings, I was attacked by a swarm of these gnats.  They hovered all around, flew into and out of my beard and hair and generally grossed me out.  I thought it was a localized phenomenon.  Perhaps we parked the car in an unfortunate spot.  I swatted the tiny, hungry little beasts away from my face and walked quickly.  This was to no avail.  They were everywhere.  It was as if the entire lake was engulfed in the swarm.  At least I got this beautiful, seemingly serene photograph before we retreated in earnest.
