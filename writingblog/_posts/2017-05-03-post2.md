(Near Portland, OR) Our first stop on the road trip - <a href="http://www.oregon.com/attractions/multnomah_falls">Multnomah Falls</a>! It was a short drive from Portland, but quite the hike up to the top.  We were donut powered, but I still needed to stop and rest a few times.  I definitely need to be getting more exercise.

The hike to the top was worth it, though.  A sense of accomplishment coupled with a lovely view.  Going down wasn't nearly the task as going up!  A great start to the first day...
