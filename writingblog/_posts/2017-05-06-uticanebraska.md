Growing up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_New_York">Utica, NY</a>, I remember thinking that my hometown’s name was unique.  (Folks from out of town often confuse it with “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca,_New_York">Ithaca</a>” and I politely correct them.)  I can’t remember when I learned about other Uticas, but I’ve often wondered what these places were like.  Cruising through Nebraska, we came across a sign for “Utica” and it was obvious we had to pull off the freeway to see it.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_Nebraska">Utica, Nebraska</a> (1800 miles from my hometown) is a small town of about 900 people. In contrast, Utica, NY is home to about 62,000 people - although at one time the population was just over 100,000.  Whereas my Utica fell on hard times, Nebraska’s Utica seemed like a quiet rural village.  Well, quiet until a train barreled down the tracks in the middle of town, blasting its horn the whole time!
