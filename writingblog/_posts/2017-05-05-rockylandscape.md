(Utah / Wyoming)  Honestly, I can't say exactly where this picture was taken.  My apologies to the good people of Utah and Wyoming - but, in the humble opinion of this native New Yorker, I think this breathtaking landscape could have been in either state.  My uncle did some of the driving and I took picture after picture of interesting and gigantic rock formations.  The road was winding and the vistas were incredible.  I cherished this landscape because I knew it was basically the edge of the far west. We would enter the plains soon enough, and these rocks would be replaced by endless expanses of sky and fields.  The latter has a certain beauty all to its own, but if I had the choice of which scenery I'd prefer on the open road, it would be the former. (Sorry, Nebraska...)
